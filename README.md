After that, type `composer install` command into you terminal for installing vendor requirements, and start to create your amazing projects, just type `npm install` and `npm run dev` commands for compile your amazing codes.

## Writing your own SASS and JS

All you have to do is writing your code into non-compiled files. You can find the files in Resources/js and Resources/sass folder. Your admin panel SCSS files located in resources/sass/admin and JS files are located in resources/js/admin.

After compiling the whole code with `npm run dev`, all of your codes goes into public/panel directory.

Happy Coding!
